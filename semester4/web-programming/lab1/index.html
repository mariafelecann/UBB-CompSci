            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
                Folk music is the oldest form of Romanian musical creation, characterised by great vitality;<br /> it is the defining source of the cultured musical creation, both religious and lay. 
                Gheorghe Zamfir, is famous throughout the world today and helped popularize a traditional Romanian folk instrument, the panpipes.<br />
                The religious musical creation, born under the influence of Byzantine music adjusted to the intonations of the local folk music, saw a period of glory between the 15th and 17th centuries, when reputed schools of liturgical music developed within Romanian monasteries. Western influences brought about the introduction of polyphony in religious music in the 18th century, a genre developed by a series of Romanian composers in the 19th and 20th centuries.

                <h3>Traditional Music</h3>
                <p>
                    Traditional Romanian music reflects a confluence of sounds similar to Central European (especially Hungarian) as well as Balkan traditional music. In Romanian folk music, emphasis is on melody rather than percussion, with frequent use of the violin for melody. The melody itself and especially the melodic embellishments are reminiscent of music from further south in the Balkans.
                </p>
                <p>Some of the most popular instruments used to play traditional music are the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>violin</li>
                    <li>fluieraș (small pipe)</li>
                    <li>țilincă (another type of flute)</li>
                    <li>țambal</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Doina</h3>
                <p>The most widespread form of Romanian folk music is the doina.</p>
                <p>Doina is poetic and often melancholic, sometimes compared to the blues for that reason. Doinas are often played with a slow, free rhythm melody against a fast accompaniment pattern in fixed tempo, giving an overall feeling of rhythmic tension. Melodies are sometimes repeated in differing songs and typically follow a descending pattern</p>
                <p>A popular doina is 'Lie Ciocarlie' sang by Maria Lătărețu: </p>
