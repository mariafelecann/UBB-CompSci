# Toy Language Interpreter

This java project implements a toy language interpreter with a JavaFX graphic user interface . The interpreter supports basic programming constructs such as variable declarations, assignments, arithmetic expressions, conditional statements, loops, file operations, heap manipulation, semaphore handling, and fork statements for concurrent execution.

## Features
- Supports a simple syntax for programming constructs including variable declarations, assignments, conditionals, loops, and more.
- Performs type checking to ensure type safety in the interpreted programs.
- Utilizes JavaFX for creating a user-friendly graphic interface to interact with the interpreter.
- Allows users to run toy language programs directly from the GUI interface.
- Provides a list of example programs for users to choose from and execute.
