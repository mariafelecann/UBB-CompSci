# Welcome to the Obstruction Game! 🎉

In this game, you'll be pitted against an AI opponent as you take turns marking squares on a grid. The goal? To outsmart the AI and emerge victorious!

One player is 'O' and the other is 'X', and the first player unable to move loses.The players take turns in writing their symbol in an empty cell. Placing a symbol blocks all of the neighbouring cells from both players, and you can optionally indicate this by shading them.

Let the games begin, and may the most creative strategist emerge victorious! 🏆✨
