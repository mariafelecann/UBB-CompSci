# Welcome to the Obstruction Game! 🎉

Players take turns in marking squares on a grid. The first player unable to move loses.

Description
The game is played on a grid; 6 x 6 is a good size. One player is 'O' and the other is 'X'.

The players take turns in writing their symbol in an empty cell. Placing a symbol blocks all of the neighbouring cells from both players, and you can optionally indicate this by shading them

Let the games begin, and may the most creative strategist emerge victorious! 🏆✨
