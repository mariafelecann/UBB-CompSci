Synchronization Rules

- Global Serial Number: 
Mutex serialNumberLock ensures serial numbers are unique and incremented correctly

- Account Balance and Log: 
Each Account object has an accountLock mutex that protects both 
the balance and the log during transfers

- Transfer Operation: 
The source and destination accounts are locked in a fixed order 
(to prevent deadlocks) during a transfer operation

- Consistency Check: 
All accounts are locked during a consistency check to prevent operations from interfering
with the check
